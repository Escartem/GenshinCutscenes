## How to download
You can :
* [Browse the files](https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinCutscenes/tree/master/VideoAssets) and download the ones you need individually
* [Download the entire repo](https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinCutscenes/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) as a zip file (~6Gb)
* Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinCutscenes` including .git folder (~12Gb)

## Some details

* all cutscenes are in `.mp4` format with english voicelines and no subtitles, I do not plan to add other languages unless being asked so if you want to see another one just [create a discussion](https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinCutscenes/discussions/new) and ask it here
* most cutscenes are in the folder with the name of the region it is related to, however older cutscenes are in the main folder so make sure to check everything when searching for one specific video
* due to github limitations, cutscenes that are more than 100mb are in splitted zip files, be sure to have both `.zip` and `.z01` files when extracting
